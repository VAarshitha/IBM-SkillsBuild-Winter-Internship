# IBM-SkillsBuild-Winter-Internship
This repository showcases my work during the IBM SkillsBuild Winter Internship Program. It includes tasks such as loading and analyzing the cars.csv dataset, performing statistical analysis (mean, median, percentiles), and creating visualizations (histograms, boxplots, barplots) using Python for data-driven insights.
