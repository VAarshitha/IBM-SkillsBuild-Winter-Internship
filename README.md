IBM SkillsBuild Winter Internship Program
This repository contains the work completed during my participation in the IBM SkillsBuild Winter Internship Program. The project focuses on data analysis and visualization using Python, with key tasks and findings from three assignments:

Key Tasks:
Data Loading & Analysis:
Loaded the cars.csv dataset and performed data analysis.
Displayed basic information, such as rows and columns.
Calculated summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).

Statistical Analysis:
Interpreted the 25th and 75th percentiles of the dataset.

Data Visualization:
Visualized data using histograms, boxplots, barplots, and scatter plots.
Applied appropriate visualizations for numerical and categorical variables.

Key Files:
cars.csv: The dataset used for analysis.
Final_Presentation.pptx: A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the tasks and results.
Learning_Plan_Certificate.pdf: My certificate for completing the Learning Plan as part of the program.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Python
Anaconda (Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
Data Analysis & Visualization

Conclusion:
This internship enhanced my skills in data analysis, statistical interpretation, and data visualization. It also provided a solid understanding of how to effectively use Python for data-driven insights.
